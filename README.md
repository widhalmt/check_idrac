Icinga plugin to check health of Dell servers via iDRAC.

The original plugin was created by Nguyen Duc Trung Dung. You can find him at http://ndtdung.blogspot.de/ . The first commit contains the original script without any changes. Although there are no licensing inforation in the plugin itself some download locations state that it is licensed under GPL and the original author gave his permission to redistribute the plugin and acknowledged that it uses the GPL. Thank you a lot for that.

The modified version is hosted at https://github.com/widhalmt/check_idrac where it's issue tracker is located, too.
